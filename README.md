# CounterService
This application contains three pages, two of which refer to the GO-service, which in turn considers the number of users visiting the page.
This application does this thanks to a script that runs in a browser on the client side. This js-script saves the state in cookies to know if the user has visited this page. If the user visited the page for the first time, then the state is saved in cookies and a request is sent to the service to count +1 visits of a specific page. GET-request to the service should include a link to access the current page, which in turn is the key in the Redis database. Also an optional parameter is a visit label. If the tag is present, then the user visited the page for the first time, if not, then the application turned to the service to simply find out the number of visits to a particular page.
